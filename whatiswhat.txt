Deepire3
- was the third attempt to do clause selection in Vampire using clause derivation features and recursive (tree) neural networks
- previous two were done with Karel, but left (so far) unfinished
- number 3 I hacked alone before AITP2020 in September 2020
- it relies on a branch deepire3 in the Vampire repo
- and uses Pytorch1.6

Deepire3.1 is meant to be polishing of Deepire3
- to serve as a basis of a reasonable publication
- to perform ablations of various kinds, not to rely on intuitions only
- to also support AVATAR, and non-discount saturation algorithms (including LRS)
